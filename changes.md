### 15. Key Features Section Replacement
**Replace:** Key Features section
**With:** Our Product section

**New Section Content:**

**Our Product**

**Waste Identification and Tracking**
Our cutting-edge waste-recognition software and sensors tracks the type of food being wasted and seamlessly transfers this valuable data to an easy-to-access database to provide insights on how much wasted food is produced. Knowledge is power.

**Automatic Waste Classification**
This waste is also classified as 'brown' (carbon-rich items like paper or twigs) or 'green' (nitrogen-rich items like fruit and veggie scraps) for easy composting. Simply top up to the necessary amounts and hit ideal green-to-brown ratios: no hassle, no fuss.

**Odorless Composting**
Scared of the smell? Don't worry. Our bin's design prevents any unpleasant from leaving it. Dispose responsibly, forget promptly.

**Providing Predictive Analytics**
Our AI software uses historical data to forecast future waste generation, thereby recommending measures to optimise inventory and procurement, as well as total food production (which dishes were most overproduced?). Save money, brain space, and the planet.

### 16. Detailed Feature Descriptions Addition
**Add comprehensive feature descriptions including:**

**Core Features:**
- **Automated Waste Identification & Tracking**: Each time food waste is disposed, the bin's camera and sensors log the type of food (e.g. vegetables, meat, starches) and its weight. Over time it learns to recognize ingredients and dishes, even in a mixed waste stream, capturing near 100% of what's discarded. This provides rich data on what is being wasted and how much.

- **Compost Classification (Green vs Brown)**: The system can classify organic waste into "green" (nitrogen-rich, e.g. fruits, veggies) vs "brown" (carbon-rich, e.g. paper, dry leaves), which is crucial for composting. This helps ensure the right balance for efficient composting processes. For venues doing on-site composting or anaerobic digestion, the bin's feedback can guide staff to add appropriate brown materials when needed, optimizing the compost mix and preventing malfunctions.

- **Waste Reduction & Cost Savings**: By analyzing waste patterns, the bin reveals insights that help kitchens reduce overproduction and inefficiency. Managers can see which dishes or ingredients are most wasted and adjust purchasing, portion sizes, or menus accordingly. This leads to significant waste reduction – often cutting food waste by 30–50% – and corresponding cost savings on ingredients. On average, users of such AI bins have reduced food waste by about 50% and cut costs 2–8% in commercial kitchens. Every 1% reduction in food waste can save a restaurant around S$10,000 per year in operating costs.

- **Regulatory Compliance & Reporting**: For large Singapore establishments now required to segregate and report food waste, a smart bin automates the tracking. It accurately measures organic waste quantities (separated from non-food trash) per day or per tenant, streamlining compliance reporting. The data helps prove that food waste was properly segregated and can feed into annual waste reports mandated by NEA. Moreover, by detecting non-food contaminants (e.g. plastics, metal) in the waste stream, the bin can alert staff, thereby improving source-segregation quality and protecting on-site treatment equipment (which can break down if contamination is high).

- **Predictive Analytics**: Using historical trends, the system can forecast future waste generation and identify patterns. For instance, it might predict that on Mondays the lunch buffet waste will be high in certain categories, prompting chefs to prepare less of those items. It can also optimize inventory and procurement, forecasting demand more accurately to prevent oversupply. Some systems even calculate the monetary value of the waste in real time, effectively creating a "waste bill" that motivates staff to improve and lets managers quantify savings from waste reduction efforts.

- **Environmental and Social Impact**: By reducing waste, the bin helps cut the carbon footprint of operations. Food waste is a major source of greenhouse emissions (8–10% of annual global emissions) when disposed. Waste tracking bins have enabled sites to save thousands of meals from the trash, translating to tons of CO₂ emissions averted. Additionally, detailed waste data raises awareness among kitchen staff and management, driving a culture shift towards sustainability. In some cases, identifying excess edible waste can lead to more donations of surplus food, benefiting the community.
