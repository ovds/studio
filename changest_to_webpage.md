Fix the images for the reduce repurpose redistribute sections (reduce: food waste photo, repurpose: compost photo, redistribute: farm/growing plant photo 

Replace the text under each section with the below text: 

The root of our solution to food waste is in reducing it. We do this through incorporating tracking of food types and predictive analytics in order to provide businesses with insights to strategically reduce the food that they cook and purchase based on past data. Buying our product not only reduces food waste generated, but your costs as well. 

This is where our smart bin shines. Food waste is classified into "green" (nitrogen-rich) and "brown" (carbon-rich) materials using our advanced AI and sensor technology. The bin then processes these materials to create nutrient-rich compost, ensuring the ideal ratio for optimal decomposition by sending easy-to-follow reminders to top up brown waste. This repurposes one man’s trash into another man’s treasure. 

The final, crucial step is closing the loop. The high-quality compost produced by our bins is collected and redistributed to local farms across Singapore. This initiative directly supports the nation's "30 by 30" goal by boosting local food production, enhancing soil quality, and creating a truly sustainable farm-to-table-to-farm ecosystem.
