Waste Identification and Tracking  

Our cutting-edge waste-recognition software and sensors tracks the type of food being wasted and seamlessly transfers this valuable data to an easy-to-access database to provide insights on how much wasted food is produced. Knowledge is power.  

 

Automatic Waste Classification 

This waste is also classified as ‘brown’ (carbon-rich items like paper or twigs) or ‘green’ (nitrogen-rich items like fruit and veggie scraps) for easy composting. Simply top up to the necessary amounts and hit ideal green-to-brown ratios: no hassle, no fuss. 

 

Odorless Composting  

Scared of the smell? Don’t worry. Our bin’s design prevents any unpleasant from leaving it. Dispose responsibly, forget promptly. 

 

Providing Predictive Analytics  

Our AI software uses historical data to forecast future waste generation, thereby recommending measures to optimise inventory and procurement, as well as total food production (which dishes were most overproduced?). Save money, brain space, and the planet.
